> _“Writers are a bunch of depressed narcissists”_

… I read that shocking statement somewhere. But it’s true, I admit, that most talented authors like Twain, Plath, Fitzgerald, etc., to name a few, all couldn’t escape from what Hemmingway sarcastically named “The Artist’s Reward.” He himself, after miserable years suffering from depression and constant pressure to write another masterpiece, seek freedom with a bullet to his head. Even though such reality is harsh, there are more writers now than at any time in history. And I, too, love writing like it is something I need to survive. Well, that is obviously a stretch but, scribbling is a habit of mine.

> _“When your feelings build up and harden and die inside, then you‘re in big trouble”_

This quote of Haruki Murakami speaks my mind. Murakami’s oddly true contemplation about life and his ability to express it through words always give me a soothing feel of being able to see your abstract thoughts in shapes and colors. If anything, I understand the most the suffocation of drowning in your own deep sea of feelings and the relentless waves of emotion keeps drenching you further down. But the moment I let that forceful stream of thoughts running out onto my 10 tips of fingers and onto the clickety-clackety keyboard, I know I am safe. Thoughts, words, and pages poured out of me. Like someone immediately pull the plug at the bottom level of the trapped water, everything just drains away. And that is why I write. Randomly or purposefully. It helps me kill time. It keeps me sane from overflown emotions during my days living away from home. I am better with written words than spoken ones. My inextricably intertwined thoughts demand time to be untied and pull into straight strings of words. 
That is why I communicate mostly through my writing. And again, through writing, my past moments, though happened once, will repeat time and time again through my pieces of work, intact. They become my closest copies, the reflections of my life. When I laugh, they laugh; I cry, they cry; I am worried, they are also worried. Seeing them being materialized in front of me I emotionally get in touch with my past selves, the one from my first date; the one from my first heartbreak, etc., those I might forget someday when my brain finally put them into oblivion to clear up space.

> _“Create your own style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others”_

The materials that I work with comes from my ordinary life, woven together through my own quirky alchemy, to form into a tapestry of textures and colors, of puzzles and characters, of emotional states and rhetoric stories aspiring to touch one’s inner core when he or she happen to tune in the same wave length. I write mostly to find my own meaning, but also to resonate with others’, to connect souls and warm hearts. For that I must learn to write no such thing belonging to that fancy and unreachable world where matters become overly decorative as to become unintelligible. After all, people do not admire what they cannot understand. 

Though I let my ego overshadow my writing occasionally, I try not to be so prideful that I’ll be easily prone to depression once criticism hits me. Lucky for me, since I do not have greed to make a name for myself through writing, nor am I talented enough to do so, I am free of all the expectation to be acknowledged (though I will not refuse any appreciation.); and thus, be able to write true with who I am.  Just because it is a light-hearted process, does not mean it will result in a light-hearted product.
