I came to writing with a lot of disapprovals. Please don’t blame my generation or any generations after mine for not taking writing seriously. When the grownups believe their methods of promoting a literacy device or writing, in general, are to conduct repeated brain surgeries of Nguyễn Du, Nam Cao, Hồ Xuân Hương and so on, I, as a pedagogical beneficiary, choose not to co-operate.

I understand the good intention behind the strategy. It doesn’t only serve as a historical and cultural enrichment but also a recommended projection of what a good writing should be. However, putting too much weight on one side of the equation will jeopardize the ultimate purpose why everything exists at the first place. Students come to class and tolerate a disproportion of massive time-spending on discussing the finest writings to a lack of personal expression as well as self-discoveries. A well-mixed balance between the two would do everyone an exquisite justice.

The current mechanism of delivering literacy is an extremely inefficient one to filter out the unfortunate extraordinary, individuals who are gifted with talents in writing and social cognitivism, which occupy around 2% of the pool, yet distortedly trained. What have been left out are discouraged potential writers whose passion for writing has been terribly suppressed or even demolished many long ago by the very nature of this system. Writing is not a tolerable privilege of the 2%. It should never be, for so many good reasons.

Therefore, I write, as a left-out, among those 98%, to encourage you to do so as well. Please don’t give up on writing. Please stand up to shake and to break the bars that expectations from the grownups have celled us into. Please write anything, anything at all, like a bird swinging for the first time after birth, enjoying the fresh air of the high mountains, where ahead is endless possibilities of inter-continental travels and self-discoveries. Please write every day, about everything, everything at all, so your inner thoughts are well-exercised and you can see more from this world. Please spread the message as far as you could so our fellow left-outs, from 64 different provinces and cities, alongside the beach coasts to the very end of our oceanic islands, can join the league and start writing.

Please write, because you can and you should.
