… is when we give birth to the words that may or may not belong to us. It’s an act of stretching our inherited ability to becoming aspirational. When we write, we give life to the liberating moment a seabird spreading its wings above the sea’s vastness, the sunrise that looks like a giant fireball arising from the furthest horizon, the dreadful emptiness in the eyes of a mother who has just lost her son, or the nagging frustration we’ve carried for too long inside. Writing is not trying to put on an act to become ‘an artist'; rather it is a kind of hard labor that carries mysterious power to touch souls, warm hearts, break boundaries, and shatter darkness.

As the infamous philosopher Kafka has poetically written "reading a book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us,” writing is to keep on forging the axe in a thousand degree of fire to the ultimate point of sharpness, which, hopefully, would be keen enough one day to break through the many frozen seas within others, and fore-mostly, in us. Sometimes, writing is allowing words to manifest onto paper; yet, oftentimes, it looks more like hours of idly sitting in front of a soulless blank page bearing boredom, many self-doubts, and an immense sense of nothingness. In those moments, we are afraid because we’ve been fully aware of language’s fleetingness, as an emerald-striped butterfly could lift its wings anytime a strange object has been near. When we are close, the creature has already made its way. Perhaps, it’s not technically as challenging as capturing a butterfly, yet the process is both mentally and emotionally as hard. The element of personal courage is behind the main engine that pushes one’s dedication to writing forward. To courageously stand firm amidst critical moments of external judgments, even from the ones we hold dear to our hearts. To bravely embrace the darkest time we've come to struggle with the evil inside, the inner insecurity. And to mercilessly listen to that unknown voice from within, telling us to “keep going.” 

To write is to dive right into two parallel lives, the one we write on paper, and the one letting us write on paper. Before writing, we only know of the former in random moments of feeling “inspired” as we’ve read or heard of some worldly beautiful use of language. That life has always been there, yet, not fully known to the latter one. When we write, two lives are being lived at once, in harmony, co-creating this mysterious rhythm of life that is primal to us. While we can live two lives at once, why choose to limit ourselves, to only one.
