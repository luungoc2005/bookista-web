Please don’t blame my generation or any generations after mine for not taking writing seriously. When the grownups believe their methods of promoting a literacy device or writing, in general, are to conduct repeated brain surgeries of Nguyễn Du, Nam Cao, Hồ Xuân Hương and so on, I, as a pedagogical beneficiary, choose not to co-operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the good intention behind the strategy. It doesn’t only serve as a historical and cultural enrichment but also a recommended projection of what a good writing should be. However, putting too much weight on one side of the equation will jeopardize the ultimate purpose why everything exists at the first place. Students come to class and tolerate a disproportion of massive time-spending on discussing the finest writings to a lack of personal expression as well as self-discoveries. A well-mixed balance between the two would do everyone an exquisite justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current mechanism of delivering literacy is an extremely inefficient one to filter out the unfortunate extraordinary, individuals who are gifted with talents in writing and social cognitivism, which occupy around 2% of the pool, yet distortedly trained. What have been left out are discouraged potential writers whose passion for writing has been terribly suppressed or even demolished many long ago by the very nature of this system. Writing is not a tolerable privilege of the 2%. It should never be, for so many good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I write, as a left-out, among those 98%, to encourage you to do so as well. Please don’t give up on writing. Please stand up to shake and to break the bars that expectations from the grownups have celled us into. Please write anything, anything at all, like a bird swinging for the first time after birth, enjoying the fresh air of the high mountains, where ahead is endless possibilities of inter-continental travels and self-discoveries. Please write every day, about everything, everything at all, so your inner thoughts are well-exercised and you can see more from this world. Please spread the message as far as you could so our fellow left-outs, from 64 different provinces and cities, alongside the beach coasts to the very end of our oceanic islands, can join the league and start writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please write, because you can and you should.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dinh Nguyen Vo</name></author><summary type="html">I came to writing with a lot of disapprovals.

It’s an act of stretching our inherited ability to becoming aspirational. When we write, we give life to the liberating moment a seabird spreading its wings above the sea’s vastness, the sunrise that looks like a giant fireball arising from the furthest horizon, the dreadful emptiness in the eyes of a mother who has just lost her son, or the nagging frustration we’ve carried for too long inside. Writing is not trying to put on an act to become ‘an artist’; rather it is a kind of hard labor that carries mysterious power to touch souls, warm hearts, break boundaries, and shatter darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the infamous philosopher Kafka has poetically written “reading a book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us,” writing is to keep on forging the axe in a thousand degree of fire to the ultimate point of sharpness, which, hopefully, would be keen enough one day to break through the many frozen seas within others, and fore-mostly, in us. Sometimes, writing is allowing words to manifest onto paper; yet, oftentimes, it looks more like hours of idly sitting in front of a soulless blank page bearing boredom, many self-doubts, and an immense sense of nothingness. In those moments, we are afraid because we’ve been fully aware of language’s fleetingness, as an emerald-striped butterfly could lift its wings anytime a strange object has been near. When we are close, the creature has already made its way. Perhaps, it’s not technically as challenging as capturing a butterfly, yet the process is both mentally and emotionally as hard. The element of personal courage is behind the main engine that pushes one’s dedication to writing forward. To courageously stand firm amidst critical moments of external judgments, even from the ones we hold dear to our hearts. To bravely embrace the darkest time we’ve come to struggle with the evil inside, the inner insecurity. And to mercilessly listen to that unknown voice from within, telling us to “keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To write is to dive right into two parallel lives, the one we write on paper, and the one letting us write on paper. Before writing, we only know of the former in random moments of feeling “inspired” as we’ve read or heard of some worldly beautiful use of language. That life has always been there, yet, not fully known to the latter one. When we write, two lives are being lived at once, in harmony, co-creating this mysterious rhythm of life that is primal to us. While we can live two lives at once, why choose to limit ourselves, to only one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phong Ho</name></author><summary type="html">… is when we give birth to the words that may or may not belong to us.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Writers are a bunch of depressed narcissists”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… I read that shocking statement somewhere. But it’s true, I admit, that most talented authors like Twain, Plath, Fitzgerald, etc., to name a few, all couldn’t escape from what Hemmingway sarcastically named “The Artist’s Reward.” He himself, after miserable years suffering from depression and constant pressure to write another masterpiece, seek freedom with a bullet to his head. Even though such reality is harsh, there are more writers now than at any time in history. And I, too, love writing like it is something I need to survive. Well, that is obviously a stretch but, scribbling is a habit of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When your feelings build up and harden and die inside, then you‘re in big trouble”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote of Haruki Murakami speaks my mind. Murakami’s oddly true contemplation about life and his ability to express it through words always give me a soothing feel of being able to see your abstract thoughts in shapes and colors. If anything, I understand the most the suffocation of drowning in your own deep sea of feelings and the relentless waves of emotion keeps drenching you further down. But the moment I let that forceful stream of thoughts running out onto my 10 tips of fingers and onto the clickety-clackety keyboard, I know I am safe. Thoughts, words, and pages poured out of me. Like someone immediately pull the plug at the bottom level of the trapped water, everything just drains away. And that is why I write. Randomly or purposefully. It helps me kill time. It keeps me sane from overflown emotions during my days living away from home. I am better with written words than spoken ones. My inextricably intertwined thoughts demand time to be untied and pull into straight strings of words. 
That is why I communicate mostly through my writing. And again, through writing, my past moments, though happened once, will repeat time and time again through my pieces of work, intact. They become my closest copies, the reflections of my life. When I laugh, they laugh; I cry, they cry; I am worried, they are also worried. Seeing them being materialized in front of me I emotionally get in touch with my past selves, the one from my first date; the one from my first heartbreak, etc., those I might forget someday when my brain finally put them into oblivion to clear up space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Create your own style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials that I work with comes from my ordinary life, woven together through my own quirky alchemy, to form into a tapestry of textures and colors, of puzzles and characters, of emotional states and rhetoric stories aspiring to touch one’s inner core when he or she happen to tune in the same wave length. I write mostly to find my own meaning, but also to resonate with others’, to connect souls and warm hearts. For that I must learn to write no such thing belonging to that fancy and unreachable world where matters become overly decorative as to become unintelligible. After all, people do not admire what they cannot understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I let my ego overshadow my writing occasionally, I try not to be so prideful that I’ll be easily prone to depression once criticism hits me. Lucky for me, since I do not have greed to make a name for myself through writing, nor am I talented enough to do so, I am free of all the expectation to be acknowledged (though I will not refuse any appreciation.); and thus, be able to write true with who I am.  Just because it is a light-hearted process, does not mean it will result in a light-hearted product.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Huynh Le</name></author><summary type="html">“Writers are a bunch of depressed narcissists”</summary></entry></feed>
